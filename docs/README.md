## Features

* **Line Following & Obstacle Avoidance ðŸš§:** Enables the robot to navigate predefined paths while avoiding obstacles using phototransistors and ultrasonic sensors.
* **Ramp Navigation & Box Dragging ðŸ“¦:**  A robust mechanical design with a geared motor system enables the robot to ascend ramps and drag boxes.
* **Box Picking & Color Detection ðŸŽ¨:** A custom SolidWorks-designed robotic arm, powered by a servo motor, allows for precise box picking. A color sensor integrated into the arm enables the robot to differentiate between different colored boxes.
* **Maze Solving ðŸŒ€:** Employs a `left-hand rule algorithm`, guided by color sensing, to navigate mazes. The robot utilizes the box color to determine the correct path and destination within a maze environment.
* **Sound Detection ðŸŽ¤:** Incorporates an audio sensor that allows the robot to detect and respond to specific sound cues, enabling dynamic interactions and programmed actions based on sound triggers.
