## Features 🌟

### 1. Line Following and Obstacle Avoidance 🚧
The Sparkle Robot is adept at navigating a designated path with precision. It can follow lines with agility, making sharp turns and avoiding obstacles in its path without human intervention.

### 2. Ramp Navigation & Box Dragging 📦
Demonstrating its mechanical prowess, the robot can traverse inclined surfaces and even engage in box dragging activities. This function highlights the robot's capability to adapt to physical tasks and solve problems autonomously.

### 3. Box Picking and Color Detection 🎨
With an arm engineered in SolidWorks and powered by a servo mechanism, the robot can perform complex picking tasks. It is also equipped with a color sensor strategically positioned to detect and differentiate colors during the pick-up process.

### 4. Maze Solving 🌀
The Sparkle Robot employs a logical approach to navigate mazes. It uses the left-hand rule algorithm to find its way through mazes, identifying the correct path based on the color of the box it carries, and places it accurately in a predetermined location.

### 5. Sound Detection 🎤
Incorporating advanced auditory processing capabilities, the robot can respond to sound cues. This feature allows it to execute precise stops and movements in response to specific sounds, enhancing its interactive abilities.
