This folder contains SolidWorks STL files for 3D printing the components of the Sparkle Robot Arm. These files are designed for use with a variety of 3D printing technologies and materials.

**Component Breakdown:**

* **1_hand.STL:** This file represents the first component of the robot hand.
* **2_hand.STL:** This file represents the second component of the robot hand.
* **arm small box.STL:** This file represents a small box situated on the robot arm to keep mechanism with servo motor.
* **wheel final.STL:** This file represents a final version of a wheel component used on the robot arm, for locomotion.

**File Usage:**

* These STL files can be imported into any 3D printing software to prepare for printing.
* Users are encouraged to review the file names and orientations carefully before printing.
* It is recommended to use a slicing software compatible with your 3D printer to prepare the files for printing. 
* Choose appropriate print settings and material based on your printer's capabilities and the desired mechanical properties of the printed parts.
